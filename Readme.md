## Project Summary

As part of my advanced internship at DevelopersHub Corporation, I successfully completed three real-world Data Science & AI tasks focusing on **unsupervised learning**, **time series forecasting**, and **cost-sensitive classification**.

These projects involved full pipeline development including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and visualization using tools such as **Scikit-Learn**, **XGBoost**, **CatBoost**, **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **SHAP**.

Each task was tackled with industry-standard methodologies and with an emphasis on business impact and model interpretability.

## Completed Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering  
**Objective:** Identify distinct customer segments based on spending behavior.  
**Key Steps:**
- Performed EDA on the Mall Customers dataset.
- Applied **K-Means Clustering** and determined optimal clusters via the Elbow Method.
- Visualized clusters using **PCA**.
- Proposed marketing strategies for each segment based on spending and age group.

**Outcome:** Segmented customers into three actionable groups for targeted promotions.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Energy Consumption Forecasting  
**Objective:** Predict short-term household energy usage using time series models.  
**Key Steps:**
- Resampled power consumption data to hourly frequency.
- Engineered features like hour, weekday/weekend.
- Built and evaluated **ARIMA**, **Prophet**, and **XGBoost** models.
- Visualized actual vs. predicted energy trends.

**Outcome:** **XGBoost** outperformed other models in MAE and RMSE; provided a 7-day energy usage forecast.

### ðŸ”¹ Task 4: Loan Default Risk & Business Cost Optimization  
**Objective:** Predict loan defaults and minimize financial risk using cost-based decision thresholds.  
**Key Steps:**
- Cleaned and encoded the Home Credit dataset.
- Trained **Logistic Regression** and **CatBoost** models.
- Defined business costs for false positives and negatives.
- Adjusted classification threshold to minimize total cost.
- Analyzed feature importance using CatBoost and SHAP.

**Outcome:** Reduced overall business loss using optimized threshold; CatBoost achieved best performance.
